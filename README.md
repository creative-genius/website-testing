#### Custom function usage:
>   - ```debug(i)``` - function is executed like this: <body onload="debug(1)">
>     Number tells the function how many debug background objects there are.
>     To highlight an elements background use ```<div id="debug1"></div>   <div id="debug2"></div>``` and so on.
>      Switch states in console with ```setDebug(true)``` or ```setDebug(false)``` - (Will be stored as cookie for 10 days)
<br>
<br>
>   - ```addHTML()``` - usage: ```<a href="html/support" id="addhtml" onclick="addHTML()"> support</a> ``` 
<br>
>       Object has to contain ```id="addhtml"```, also the *href* should not contain *.html*. Will only work for ***127.0.0.1*** or ***file://***
<br>
<br>
>   - ```addIndex()``` - usage: ```<a href="../" id="addindex" onclick="addIndex()">Bundesrealgymnasium Keplerstra√üe Graz</a> ``` 
<br>
>       Object has to contain ```id="addindex"```, also the *href* should not contain *index.html*. Will only work for ***127.0.0.1*** or ***file://***
